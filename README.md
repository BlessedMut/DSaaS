# DSaaS
Big businesses typically have a lot of data that needs to be examined and the outcomes assessed. We call such a large volume of data "big data," and analyzing it is a time-consuming procedure. Companies hire data scientists who are given data sets and expected results. Data science as a service (DSaaS) is an integrated solution for data analytics in which data scientists are not required to be engaged by each organization. With a global environment hosted on any platform, DSaaS can be applied on a global scale. For increased efficiency and dependability, the concept proposes a DSaaS web platform with grid computing/multicore computing in cooperative technology.
